## Assembler
The assembler works by taking input from input.txt and if the code is correct outputs the binary to output.txt
In case of an error the assembler tells the line at which the error occured and relevent message for the error.

The assembler takes care of all the commands provided, converts the register to the corresponding binary value, assigns binary to labels and variables and Then uses them to generate the binary
